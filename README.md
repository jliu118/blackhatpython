# blackhatpython
OWASP study group working through the Black Hat Python book: https://www.nostarch.com/blackhatpython

There are a few preparations prior to starting this book, rather than install dependencies as you go. 
I prefer to use VMwarefusion VMs on NAT mode rather than my host machiene.
Note we had trouble with arper.py on Virtual Box, and I recommend using VMwarefusion. 

Install a Kali Linux VM:
 * With a secondary user, and text editor with python packages
  
Install a Windows VM:
 * With python 


MISSING FILES:
* ch 2 - SSH Tunneling: rforward.py
* ch 6 - Bing for Burp: bhp_bing.py

PARTIAL: (merge request opportunity)
* ch 6 - Turning Website Content into Password Gold: (whatever file name you saved as)
* ch 7 - All entries

Python2 => 3 conversion in this branch
